# Auto Map Art

## ABOUT
Auto Map Art is a meteor addon created by Wildbush that allows the automatic building of flat map arts or similar structures with the use of litematica
## <span style="color:red">This mod does require litematica and meteor client</span>

## HOW TO USE 
1. First place a litematica schematic where ever youd like to build it
2. Set locations in the module settings for where it should get materials from
3. Enable the module and wait for it build your map

## TODO
- should changing building pattern to be more efficent (not just one block type at a time)?
- allow auto locking and clearing of map
- issue where it goes to carpet location thinking its a chest location
